To be able to run this code you will need a few things.  First you need an API key from Google MAP's API and it needs to be added into the as a script at the bottom of your HTML on the index.html

<script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key="YOUR KEY GOES HERE&callback=initMap"></script>



Next you will need to add your own weather API key from https://api.openweathermap.org
// This is our API key
var APIKey = "Enter Your Weather API key";
