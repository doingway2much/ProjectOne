My take on a mobile app.
This is SMarta. SMarta takes in Google Maps, Google Geo, Marta, and Weather API's to give the user a fully functional app
to find your way around Atlanta without having to jump from one app to another. SMarta tells you the nearest bus stop and its location and returns with coordinates, directions and travel time on foot to find the nearest bus stop to you. It also finds all buses in your area to let you know if it will be arriving to that stop on time or not. This way you know if you are going to make the right bus and on time.
